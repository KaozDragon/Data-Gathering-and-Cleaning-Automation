# Data-Gathering-and-Cleaning-Automation
The purpose of the Address Match script is to find active service locations in 2 large datasets based on a list of client addresses. This solves the complex problem of mismatching addresses in several datasets and saves many hours of manual search. It takes in 3 files (1 client list and 2 datasets from different systems), cleans them to a standardized format, then pulls all the data from the 2 company datasets. Fuzzy match logic (Levenshtein distance of 3) is used for the address name. The address #s, states, and zip codes are set to exact match. Due to memory limitations, the script breaks down all the addresses into 50 states and will only seek addresses in the states that are part of the client list. The script has also been optimized to only process the 2 company data sets the first time itâ€™s run, making subsequent usage much faster.

The Spend Report saves time by reading in a file with customer #s and filtering through millions rows of data based on the set date range. This was previously done manually by going through several files of invoices that allowed room for error when inputting a large set of customer #s.
