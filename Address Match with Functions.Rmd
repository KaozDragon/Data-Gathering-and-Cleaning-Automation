This program takes in a CSV file containing a list of client addresses and checks them against two different data sets to determine which locations our company services. It then retrieves the data pertaining to those locations. Due to the wide variety of address naming conventions used by clients, as well as potential misspellings, fuzzy matching is employed as an option.

The program first reads in the three data sets, subsets the addresses, and then breaks the data up based on states for processing. This approach helps to deal with larger data sets when local machines encounter memory problems. Next, the program cleans the data to a standard format, performs exact matching based on zip code and address number, and finally employs fuzzy matching on the address portion to handle misspellings. The fuzzy match uses the Levenshtein distance, which users can manually adjust.

Please note that, in order to increase efficiency, I have incorporated checks to see if the two company datasets have already been loaded. If so, it also checks if the data has been cleaned already. This prevents the program from loading and cleaning the data multiple times while changing the client file throughout the day.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
